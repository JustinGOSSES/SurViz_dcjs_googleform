# SurViz_dcjs_googleform

in progress

## To Do
- Change CSS so default text color is black so that text can be seen even against white background if bar is small
- use boostrap to make responsive and look nice
- establish default sizes for each chart type
- decide how to take questions from data ingest and add as text in html
- build most html from data input such that the number of questions or types of questions / answers doesn't need to be known for the code to work. 
- play around with different table looks for sentence responses
- play around with word charts for small 1-3 word responses
- add reset button to bring selections based to normal!
