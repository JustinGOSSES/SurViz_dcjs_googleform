A data viz team cannot improve an organization if it's constrained to giving clients what they think they want.,"Everyone- thank you for the informative and inspirational pieces describing our industry. There're an incredible number of articles- interviews- podcasts- and meta-visualizations available to anyone interested in the job. That said- please share your negative or difficult data viz career experiences as well. You can be anonymous! For many data viz practitioners the market is dismissive and ignorant (even hostile) but positivity is the constant byword of the community.
